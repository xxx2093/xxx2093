This Bash script is designed to change the network configuration on the device.
Remember that using the script can lead to loss of network connection, so be careful when using it.
To use the script:
1. Save the code as network_setup.sh
2. Make the script executable: chmod +x network_setup.sh
3. Run as root: sudo ./network_setup.sh <new_ip> <net_netmask> <new_gateway> (Replace <new_ip>, <net_netmask>, and <new_gateway> with the actual values.)
